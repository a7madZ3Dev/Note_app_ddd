# Note_app_ddd 📝📒

Note is a mobile app both for Android and iOS made with Flutter. It was built using DDD as the architectural pattern, also Depending on Bloc as State Management.

Note is a mobile app for note-taking. Besides that, you can make To-Do lists inside each note. This is basically a dummy project that was intended to help me understand the Domain-Driven design. Nevertheless, the idea was also to build a nice UI to go along with the more technical aspect of the app.

Note uses Firebase as the back-end provider. Services such as Authentication and Firestore help the application to run as expected.
